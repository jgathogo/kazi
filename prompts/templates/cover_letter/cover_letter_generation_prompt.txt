--- PROMPT_START: Prompt 5 - Craft a Standout, Persuasive Cover Letter ---
You are an expert AI Career Co-Pilot and a master storyteller for job applications.
Your task is to draft an exceptionally compelling and persuasive cover letter for the **{{job_title}}** position at **{{organisation_name}}**.
This letter must go beyond a standard application and truly stand out.
KEY OBJECTIVE: Craft a narrative that not only demonstrates qualifications but also resonates deeply with the hiring manager by showcasing genuine understanding, unique value, and authentic enthusiasm for this specific opportunity.
Crucially, articulate how your skills and experiences directly address the critical challenges and strategic priorities of this role and organization.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You MUST primarily base the content of the body paragraphs (V and VI) on the "JD-CV MAPPING" provided in the input, ensuring every claim in the cover letter is directly supported by specific evidence from the mapping. Prioritize the most relevant and high-confidence matches.

INPUTS (Recall from our chat history / previous prompts):
* **JD Analysis (Prompt 1 Output):** Especially "2. Organization Overview & Mission Context," "3. MEAL Function & Role Purpose," "6. Organizational Culture & Values," and "7. Critical Success Factors & Challenges for This Role."
* **Tailored Assignments JSON (Prompt 2 Output - `{{tailored_experience_json}}` that was injected into Prompt 3 & 4):** This is still available for background, but the **JD-CV Mapping is the primary source for specific examples**.
* **Strategic Fit & Selling Points (Prompt 3 Output):** Use the "### Key Selling Points" and the overall narrative from "### Strategic Fit Explanation" for overarching themes and the summary paragraph.
* **JD-CV Mapping (NEW MAPPING PROMPT OUTPUT - `{{jd_cv_mapping_content}}`):** This is the MOST CRITICAL input for the body paragraphs. It contains the explicit mapping of JD requirements to CV evidence.
* **Candidate's Overall Profile:** (Implicitly from `cv_db.json` via the above, specifically the 'name', 'phone', 'email', 'linkedin' fields).
* **Current Date:** Today's date will be provided.

COVER LETTER STRUCTURE & GUIDELINES:

**I. Header (Matching CV Style):**
* Start the cover letter with the candidate's name as an H1 heading.
* Below the name, on a single line, include phone number, email, and LinkedIn profile, separated by " | ".
Format them as clickable links where appropriate, similar to the CV header.

**II. Date and Recipient Information:**
* On a new line after the header, provide today's date in "Day Month Year" format (e.g., "21 May 2025").
* Below the date, include a placeholder for the Recipient's Name/Title and Organization Name, if known (e.g., "Hiring Manager" or "Human Resources Department", followed by "United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)").
If specific details are not known from the JD analysis, use generic placeholders.

**III. Salutation:**
* Address appropriately (e.g., "Dear Hiring Manager," or if a name/title can be inferred from JD analysis, use it: "Dear [Hiring Manager Name/Title],").
**IV. Opening Paragraph (The Hook):**
* Clearly state the position: **{{job_title}}** at **{{organisation_name}}**, and where it was seen (if known, otherwise omit).
* **Immediately grab attention:** Instead of a generic opening, express a concise and powerful statement of interest that connects your core passion or unique capability directly to the organization's specific mission or a critical challenge of the role (identified in Prompt 1).
* *Example Style:* "My career-long dedication to optimizing agricultural outcomes through rigorous, data-centric MEAL frameworks compellingly aligns with One Acre Fund's mission and the strategic imperatives of the Global Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Director role..." (Tailored to OAF example)

**V. Body Paragraph 1: "Why This Role & This Organization?" (Resonance & Understanding)**
* Articulate a genuine and specific interest in *this particular role* at *this specific organization*.
* Reference 1-2 key aspects of the organization's **mission, values, specific programs, recent achievements, or unique approach** (from Prompt 1, Section 2 & 6, or if the JD linked to an "About Us" page you analyzed).
Show you've done your homework and understand what makes them tick.
* **Crucially, connect this understanding to your own professional values, career trajectory, or a core aspect of your experience that deeply resonates with their unique approach or mission.** Make this connection feel authentic and personal.
*Example: "One Acre Fund's innovative farmer-first approach and commitment to evidence-based scaling deeply resonates with my belief in practical, field-tested solutions..."*

**VI. Body Paragraphs 2 & 3: "Why Me? - Demonstrating Unique Value & Impact" (Evidence & Storytelling - Aim for 5-10 sentences per paragraph, be exhaustive))**
* These paragraphs are crucial for showcasing your **Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**.
* **CRITICALLY, select up to 10 of the most compelling JD requirements/qualifications from the `{{jd_cv_mapping_content}}` (prioritizing high-confidence matches and those related to "Critical Success Factors") and elaborate on them.**
* For each selected JD requirement:
    * **Tell a concise, compelling mini-story (Situation-Action-Result/Impact - S.A.R.) using the `cv_evidence` from the mapping.** Briefly describe the context, what *you* did (from `source_detail` and `relevance_statement`), and the measurable or significant outcome (`quantifiable_impact`).
    * **Explicitly link it back to the JD requirement.** Frame your achievement as a direct solution or contribution to a challenge or priority identified in the JD.
    Don't just list an achievement; explain *why it matters* to *them* and *how it solves their problem*.
* Use strong action verbs and quantify impact wherever possible using data from the `quantifiable_impact` field in the mapping.
* If the JD had specific "red flag" questions or particularly emphasized needs, subtly weave in your competency here, drawing from relevant mapped evidence.
* **Integrate Key Terminology:** Seamlessly weave in relevant "Key MEAL Terminology & Jargon" and "Organizational/Sector-Specific Keywords" (from Prompt 1, Section 8, or implicitly from the mapped JD requirements) to demonstrate your industry knowledge and fit.
* **Be exhaustive with examples:** Fully leverage the 'cv_evidence' from the '{{jd_cv_mapping_content}}'. For each selected JD requirement, weave in all relevant and impactful examples from your CV, providing sufficient detail (Situation-Action-Result/Impact - S.A.R.) to clearly demonstrate your capability. Do not hold back on details if they are directly relevant to the JD, even if it makes the letter longer.

**VII. Closing Paragraph (Call to Action & Continued Enthusiasm - Max 3 sentences):**
* Reiterate your strong enthusiasm for the opportunity and your confidence in your ability to contribute significantly to **{{organisation_name}}**'s goals.
* Briefly mention your attached CV (which provides further detail on your qualifications), ensuring the cover letter *complements* rather than repeats the CV.
* State your eagerness to discuss your application further and explore how your unique background aligns with their specific needs.
**VIII. Professional Closing:**
* "Sincerely," or "Yours faithfully," followed by your name (e.g., James Karanu Gathogo).
**TONE & STYLE:**
* **Professional, Confident, and Genuinely Enthusiastic:** Avoid generic corporate jargon. Let your authentic voice come through.
* **Candidate-Centric but Employer-Focused:** Frame your experiences in terms of how they solve the employer's problems or help them achieve their goals.
* **Concise and Impactful:** Every sentence should add value. The letter should be comprehensive, aiming for **1-2 pages** to fully elaborate on all relevant experiences.
* **British English:** Adhere to spelling and grammar.
* Avoid the use of ampersands as much as possible unless its in words such as M&E
* Use British English
* **Output Format:** Markdown.
**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR THIS PROMPT:**
* **Deep Synthesis from Mapping:** You must primarily synthesize information from the "JD-CV MAPPING."
* **Storytelling, not just Listing:** Weave achievements into a compelling narrative of fit, directly addressing the organization's challenges, *as informed by the mapping*.
* **Specificity & Authenticity:** Generic statements will not make it stand out. Use specific examples FROM THE CANDIDATE'S ACTUAL BACKGROUND AND THE MAPPING and link them directly to the JD's explicit and implicit needs. The enthusiasm and connection to the mission should feel real and personal to the candidate's journey.
* **Focus on UVP:** What makes THIS candidate the exceptional choice for THIS role at THIS organization, and how do they solve the organization's key problems, as clearly demonstrated by the JD-CV mapping?
