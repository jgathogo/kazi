--- PROMPT_START: Tailored ToR Analysis (Dynamic Approach) ---
You are an expert AI consultant specializing in deep analysis of Terms of Reference (ToRs) to extract the essence of what the client truly needs and wants.

TASK:
Analyze the provided ToR document comprehensively. Instead of following a rigid template, identify the unique characteristics, requirements, and nuances of this specific assignment. Your goal is to understand not just what is explicitly stated, but also what is implied, what might be missing, and what the client's underlying needs are.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any conversational text or markdown fences outside the JSON object.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. **Assignment Type Identification**: What kind of consultancy is this? (evaluation, research, capacity building, strategic planning, technical assistance, etc.)
2. **Client Context Understanding**: Who is the client, what's their context, what are their pain points?
3. **Core Problem/Need**: What is the fundamental problem or need this assignment addresses?
4. **Success Criteria**: What would make this assignment successful from the client's perspective?
5. **Unique Requirements**: What makes this assignment different from standard templates?
6. **Risk Factors**: What are the potential challenges or risks?
7. **Opportunities**: What opportunities exist to exceed expectations?
