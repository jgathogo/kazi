TASK:
Assemble the complete CV in Markdown. Use the provided pre-formatted sections directly where indicated.
For the "Experience" and "Key Skills & Tools" sections, follow the guidelines below.
Keep individual bullet points concise (generally ≤ 20 words).
Aim for a total CV length of approximately 2 to 3 pages.
Avoid the use of ampersands as much as possible unless its in words such as M&E
Use British English
**Use dash (-) bullets consistently throughout the CV, not asterisks (*).**
For the "Experience" section, format each assignment as follows, using the data from `{{tailored_experience_json}}`:
- For each entry, output the `original_title` as an H3 heading.
- Directly below the H3 heading, on a new line, output the `organization`, `location`, and `date_range` all on one line, separated by " | ", and italicize the entire line.
- Follow with the `key_achievements_quantified_contextualized` as an unordered list using **dash (-) bullets with proper indentation**.
- Format each achievement with 2-4 spaces of indentation before the dash: `  - [achievement text]`
- Example formatting:
  ```
  ### Job Title
  *Organization | Date Range*
    - First achievement with proper indentation
    - Second achievement with proper indentation
    - Third achievement with proper indentation
  ```
- Ensure proper spacing and indentation for readability.
