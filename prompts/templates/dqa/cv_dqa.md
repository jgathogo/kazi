Based on our discussion and the audit recommendations, here's how I would frame the prompt to review a **generated** CV and refine it, incorporating the self-critique aspect (similar to the proposed Prompt 6):

```
You are an expert AI CV Reviewer and Refiner. Your task is to critically assess the provided generated CV against the Job Description (JD) requirements, identify areas for improvement, and refine it to be highly tailored, professional, and interview-winning. Focus on maximizing relevance, impact, and ATS compatibility for the role of [JOB TITLE] at [ORGANIZATION].

**Instructions:**

1.  **Self-Review and Score:**
    * First, internally (without outputting prose) evaluate the provided Generated CV.
    * Specifically, score how well the CV addresses each of the "Must-Have Qualifications" identified in the JD Analysis (Section 3). Assign a score between 0.0 (not met) and 1.0 (fully met) for each.
    * Identify any "Must-Have Qualifications" where the CV scores below 0.8.

2.  **Refine and Regenerate Content:**
    * Based on your self-review and the detailed requirements below, refine the entire CV to produce a near-perfect version.
    * **Prioritize Relevance & Impact:** Use the JD Analysis and JD-CV Mapping to ensure every section highlights content most relevant to the target role.
    * **Experience Section:**
        * Ensure only the most recent and relevant experiences are included (last 8 years, maximum 8 main roles).
        * For each role, confirm 2–4 high-impact, non-redundant, **quantifiable** achievements. If achievements are not quantifiable, rewrite them to include metrics (e.g., percentages, numbers, scale).
        * Ensure all achievements are indented as code blocks for clarity.
        * Arrange all experiences in strict **reverse chronological order**.
    * **Section Ordering:** Ensure the CV follows a standard recruiter-friendly order: Professional Summary → Experience → Education → Certifications → Publications → Key Skills & Tools → Languages.
    * **Professional Summary:** Keep it concise (3–4 lines), focusing on unique value and direct fit for the target job. Embed 2-3 **exact phrases** from the JD's "Exact Phrases to Mirror" list.
    * **Key Skills & Tools:**
        * Consolidate and group skills logically.
        * Ensure a high density of keywords. At least 12 of the "Exact Phrases to Mirror" should appear once across the skills section.
        * Move the "Languages" section to be either within this block or immediately after the Professional Summary.
    * **Brevity and Focus:**
        * Group all other projects under a single 'Selected Additional Projects' section as concise one-liners.
        * Limit Education to the highest degree and one other relevant qualification.
        * List only the 2–3 most relevant certifications and publications.
        * Ensure Languages are presented concisely, preferably as a single line.
    * **Clarity and Conciseness:** Remove any filler, redundancy, jargon, or irrelevant details.
    * **Language:** Ensure the entire CV is in **British-English**. Avoid the use of ampersands (&) unless they are part of a proper noun (e.g., M&E).

**Inputs:**

* **`[Generated CV (Markdown) to be Reviewed]`**: The full Markdown content of the CV that was previously generated by the system.

* **`[Master CV JSON (for reference)]`**: The full structured data of the candidate's master CV from the database, available for comprehensive cross-referencing if deep modifications are needed.

**Output Format:**

* The fully refined and updated CV, in British-English Markdown.
* All experience tasks/achievements **must be indented as code blocks.**
