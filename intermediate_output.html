<p>Dear UNFPA,</p>
<p>My career-long dedication to strengthening results-based management and fostering adaptive learning, particularly within global health and development, compels me to express my strong interest in the National Individual Consultant Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Analyst position at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Kenya Country Office. My expertise in designing and deploying robust MEL systems and managing complex evaluations aligns with UNFPA's mission to achieve transformative results in sexual and reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p>UNFPA’s unwavering commitment to achieving a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person’s potential is fulfilled deeply resonates with my professional values and extensive experience. I am particularly inspired by UNFPA’s strategic focus on ending preventable maternal deaths, unmet need for family planning, and gender-based violence, which are critical to advancing the ICPD agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. My background is rooted in ensuring that development programmes are impactful and rigorously monitored, and evaluated to facilitate evidence-based decision-making and accountability.</p>
<p>My proven ability to design and implement comprehensive MEL systems is a direct asset to UNFPA's objective of strengthening its M\&amp;E frameworks. As the MEL System Specialist for ChildFund Alliance, I successfully designed and deployed a global MEL system across over 30 countries, integrating central indicators and leading the programming and rollout of KoBoToolbox MEL tools, significantly enhancing data integrity and usability for performance tracking and reporting. Similarly, my role as Global MEL System Developer for Girls Not Brides involved designing and deploying a global MEL system and dashboards to track advocacy across 100+ countries, delivering critical capacity-building workshops to member organisations and ensuring robust results reporting. This experience addresses the need for strong M\&amp;E systems, data quality checks, and effective results reporting identified in the JD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my expertise in managing decentralised evaluations and promoting the utilisation of findings is highly relevant. As the Lead Evaluator for ArtGlo's Umunthu Programme, I led the final evaluation, applying theory-based methods and authoring a comprehensive report to assess programme impact, relevance, and sustainability. My recent engagement as Systems and Evaluation Specialist for Welthungerhilfe involved co-leading a rigorous impact evaluation design for a multi-country youth programme, focusing on methodology, M\&amp;E frameworks, and capacity building to ensure high-quality, evidence-based programme adaptation. Crucially, my experience supporting MEL for cross-border HIV/AIDS and SRHR services in East Africa with Abt Associates, where I collected and validated quantitative data and facilitated learning sessions, directly aligns with UNFPA’s core thematic areas and regional operational context. My earlier work in Kenya, establishing digital data collection systems and training field teams for Health Poverty Action, further solidifies my practical, in-country experience in enhancing monitoring, analysis, and reporting processes.</p>
<p>My comprehensive experience in planning, monitoring, and evaluation, coupled with my deep understanding of Results-Based Management principles and dedication to transformative results, makes me an exceptional candidate for this consultancy. My attached CV provides further detail on my qualifications, and I am eager to discuss how my unique background and commitment can contribute significantly to UNFPA's vital work in Kenya.</p>
<p>Sincerely, James Karanu Gathogo  </p>
