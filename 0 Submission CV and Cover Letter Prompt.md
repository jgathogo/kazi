# 🧩 CV & Cover Letter Builder – Kazi Quality (Reusable Meta Prompt)

## ✅ Meta Prompt to Start a New Application

I want to create a tailored CV and cover letter for a specific job opportunity. I’ll upload the following files:
- The **Job Description** (PDF, text, or image)
- A **draft tailored CV** and **draft cover letter** (markdown format)
- A **JD-to-CV Mapping JSON** file (optional, but useful)
- My **Master CV JSON** file (full database of experience)

Please guide me **step by step** from:
1. Evaluating JD alignment,
2. Improving the tailored CV,
3. Crafting a compelling cover letter,
4. Ensuring both documents match the opportunity perfectly.
