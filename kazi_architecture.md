## **Proposed System Architecture for CV and Cover Letter Generator (Revised)**

This proposal outlines a modular and extensible Python-based architecture for your CV, cover letter, and potentially other professional document generation system. The design prioritizes separation of concerns, testability, and adaptability for future enhancements, including a web-based interface and support for different application types (e.g., job applications, consultancy proposals).

### **I. Core Principles:**

* **Modularity:** Each distinct function (data input, LLM interaction, content generation for a specific document type, output formatting) will reside in its own module or package.  
* **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic (e.g., prompt engineering, tailoring strategy) will be distinct from infrastructure concerns (e.g., API calls, file I/O, database interaction).  
* **Abstraction:** Interfaces will be defined for components like the LLM interaction, allowing for different LLM providers or models to be swapped out with minimal changes (model agnosticism).  
* **Configuration-driven:** Key parameters (e.g., file paths, LLM settings, prompt templates, document types) will be managed through configuration files or environment variables.  
* **Testability:** Smaller, focused modules are easier to unit test.  
* **Scalability & Extensibility:** Clear separation will make it easier to add new features (e.g., new document types like technical proposals, different output formats, user management) or scale existing ones.

### **III. Reasoning and Component Breakdown (Key Changes Highlighted):**

1. **app/ (Future Web Application):**  
   * **Reasoning:** No major change, but routes.py and services.py will need to handle logic for selecting and processing different "application package types" (job vs. consultancy).  
2. **core/ (Core Business Logic):**  
   * **orchestrator.py:** Becomes even more critical. It will determine the type of application package required (e.g., based on user input or configuration) and then invoke the appropriate sequence of document generators from the document\_generators/ package.  
   * **jd\_analyzer.py:** Remains largely the same for job descriptions.  
   * **tor\_analyzer.py (Future):** This new module will be responsible for parsing and analyzing Terms of Reference (TORs) specifically for consultancy opportunities. It will have its own logic and potentially different extraction focuses compared to jd\_analyzer.py.  
   * **document\_generators/ (NEW Package):**  
     * **Reasoning:** This is the main structural change to support modular document creation. Each type of document (CV, Cover Letter, Technical Proposal, etc.) gets its own generator module.  
     * **cv\_generator.py:** Focuses specifically on tailoring and assembling the CV. It would use content\_synthesizer.py for the summary and then perform CV-specific LLM calls (like Prompt 2 for assignments) and assembly (like Prompt 4).  
     * **cover\_letter\_generator.py:** Dedicated to crafting the cover letter (using logic from Prompt 5). It would also leverage jd\_analyzer.py outputs and potentially content\_synthesizer.py for thematic consistency.  
     * **(Future Modules):** technical\_proposal\_generator.py, etc., would be added here for consultancy packages. Each would have its own logic and prompts.  
   * **content\_synthesizer.py:** May still generate overarching content like a "strategic fit" summary that could be useful for both CVs and cover letters, or even introductions to proposals. Its output would be consumed by the relevant document generators.  
3. **data\_management/:**  
   * input\_handler.py: Will need to handle various input documents (JD, TOR, master CV, potentially templates for proposals).  
   * db\_connector.py: Could also store templates or common sections for consultancy proposals.  
4. **prompts/ (Prompt Management):**  
   * **Reasoning:** The templates/ subdirectory can now be further organized by document type (e.g., cv/, cover\_letter/, consultancy/) for better clarity as the number of prompts grows. A tor\_analysis\_prompt.txt would be added under consultancy/ when that feature is developed.  
   * prompt\_loader.py: Will need to load prompts from these subdirectories.  
5. **utils/static\_content\_builder.py:** Renamed from static\_cv\_parts\_builder.py to be more generic, as it might help build static parts of other documents in the future, not just CVs.  
6. **config/settings.py:** Might include a list of supported "application package types" and the default document generators to invoke for each type.

### **IV. Handling Consultancy Packages & Future Extensibility:**

* **Phased Approach:**  
  1. **Initial Focus:** Implement the job application package (CV \+ Cover Letter) using cv\_generator.py and cover\_letter\_generator.py.  
  2. **Future Expansion (Consultancy):**  
     * Activate/Develop core/tor\_analyzer.py.  
     * Add new generator modules within core/document\_generators/ (e.g., technical\_proposal\_generator.py, financial\_proposal\_generator.py, work\_plan\_generator.py).  
     * Add corresponding prompt templates in prompts/templates/consultancy/ (e.g., tor\_analysis\_prompt.txt, tech\_proposal\_prompt.txt).  
     * Update core.orchestrator.py to recognize "consultancy" as an application type and call the relevant sequence of new generators, including tor\_analyzer.py.  
     * The web application (app/) would then have an option for the user to select "Job Application" or "Consultancy Proposal," triggering the correct workflow in the backend.  
* **Shared Components:** Modules like jd\_analyzer.py (for jobs), llm\_interface.py, content\_synthesizer.py, and data\_management utilities are designed to be reusable across different document generation tasks.

### **V. Version Control:**

* This modular structure is highly conducive to version control with Git. Each component can be developed, tested, and committed independently. Branches can be used for developing new features like the consultancy package support without disrupting the main job application functionality.
